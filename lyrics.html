        <h3> Song By Aha </h3>
        <pre>
            Tell me how to think
Lay me on your riverbed tonight
They'll be chasing after us
I can't remember where you said I was
Are we different or are we the same?
Are we different or are we fair game?
Oh, take my body
Oh, just take my body
Oh, take my body
Oh, just take my body
Now that your secrets shown
I've got some secrets of my own
That you'll want to hear
Now that your cover's blown
I hear you screaming through the phone
Innocence disappears
Are we different?
Are we the same?
Are we different or are we fair game?
Oh, take my body
Oh, just take my body
Oh, take my body
Oh, take my body
Lay me on your riverbed tonight
Oh, take my body
Yeah
Oh, take my body
Oh, just take my body
Oh, take my body
Oh, take my body
